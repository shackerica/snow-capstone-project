# ServiceNow Capstone Project
This repository highlights my involvement in the ServiceNow Capstone Project, where I'm applying concepts learned in the ServiceNow Administration Fundamentals course to real-world scenarios using my app, Strawberry SupportHub. I'm actively tackling tasks related to Incident Management Configuration, User Administration, Service Catalog Automation, Knowledge Base Management, Task Assignment, and Scheduled Reports.

### Task 1: Update Incident Management 
For this task, I took the following steps:

1. Added 'sFone Model' field to Default view with properties: Name: sFone Model, Type: String, Field length: Small (40).

2. Configured its placement beneath the 'Configuration Item'.

3. Created a Non-P1 sFone Incident with Caller: Megan Burke, Category: sFone, and Short Description: My sFone will not turn on.

4. Modified the Category field to include 'sFone Model' as a new choice.
